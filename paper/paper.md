# Summary

CMakePPLang is an object-oriented extension to the CMake language written entirely using the original CMake language
with the goal of making projects built on CMake easier to create and maintain. 
That said, CMakePPLang has different coding practices, paradigms, and standards than the original CMake language, 
much in the same way that C++ coding differs from C coding despite some level of interoperability. 
Currently, CMakePPLang is used within the CMakePP organization as the 
foundation for two in-progress projects: CMakeTest and CMakeTest. CMakeTest
provides a solution for unit testing CMake and CMakePPLang code. CMaize
is a CMake tool to simplify interoperability between projects and writing 
their CMake build files.


# Statement of Need

CMake is an extensible build tool that exceeds at generating build systems
for many combinations of platforms, compilers, and build configurations.
CMake has become the *de facto* standard tool for building C, C++, and Fortran
programs of moderate to large size. However, as the size of a project increases, the
complexity of the CMake code to build it tends to also increase. 
In addition, as more tooling is built around CMake to make building projects with CMake
easier and less error prone, these tools will need to be designed in a
maintainable and testable way.[@ref_needed] 
The complexity of builds will also increase as
we move toward heterogeneous systems, requiring programs to leverage a
combination of CPUs, GPUs, and other specialized hardware. Object-
oriented programming excels at managing and maintaining large, complex code
bases[@wirth_good_2006; @ambler_realistic_1998], and there is an increasing
need for this in the CMake language.

Tobias Becker recognized these issues and wrote a purely object-oriented
language on top of CMake, called CMake++ (formerly oo-cmake).[@becker_cmake_2021]
CMake++ contains an abundance of CMake extensions. Many of those extensions
have direct overlap with extensions that are part of CMakePPLang. Features include
(among many): maps, objects, tasks/promises. Unfortunately development of
CMake++ has largely been done by a single developer and it appears to have been
abandoned, as there have only been two commits since July 2017, both in 2021.

One of the primary issues with CMake++ is the lack of documentation. While
there is some high-level documentation, there is little to no API or detailed
developer documentation. This makes it very challenging for a new developer to figure out
what is going on. Initially, forking and expanding on CMake++ was
considered, but it was determined that it would take similar time to come 
decipher CMake++ as it would to develop CMakePPLang.

*ZDC: There are other related project, listed [here](https://github.com/CMakePP/.github/blob/main/docs/source/about/other_projects.rst).
Do we want to discuss each of them? If so, I think we need to shorten the discussion of each one instead of the keeping each one around
the length of the CMake++ comparison*

CMakePPLang has been developed to provide extensions to the CMake language
which provide objected-oriented functionality and other quality-of-life
improvements. The main features of CMakePPLang are the object-oriented
functionality, addition of a map structure, strong data typing, and 
backwards-compatability with CMake. These features allow for easier general
programming in CMake, which is key to writing complex build tools in the
language.


# Basic Usage

*TLW: Give a short description of the design (maybe a picture?) and then briefly discuss each of the Features mentioned above.*

CMakePPLang is developed using CMake, so it is inherently backwards-compatible
with CMake code and can be combined with CMake in the same `CMakeLists.txt`
or `*.cmake` files. To use CMakePPLang, it is simply included like any
other CMake code after it is downloaded (\autoref{fig:include_cmakepplang}).

CMakePPLang is designed primarily to provide object-oriented funcionality
for tools designed in CMake. The first step in this process is defining a
class (\autoref{fig:class_example}). Strong typing of the member function
parameters can be seen in the example as well.

calling a member function to print "Hello world!".\label{fig:class_example}](fig/class_example.png){width=50%}

Users can also define a map to hold some basic information, like <insert example description here> (\autoref{fig:map_example}).

![Example of creating a CMakePPLang map, adding a key-value pair, and 
retrieving the value using the key.\label{fig:map_example}](fig/map_example.png){width=50%}

*ZDC: I don't know if this level of discussion is necessary, but I pulled
some of the typing discussion from the documentation here.*
Native CMake is a weakly typed language where all values are strings, and,
in certain circumstances, certain strings are interpreted as being of another
type. A common example is when a string is used as an argument to CMakeâ€™s if
statement, where the string is implicitly cast to a boolean. In practice, this
weak typing can lead to subtle, hard-to-detect errors. CMakePPLang implements
strong-typing in order to avoid/catch such errors. CMakePPLang conceptually
has three classifications of types: CMake types, Quasi-CMake types, and
pure CMakePPLang types.

First, CMakePPLang recognizes the types that CMake may interpret a
string as in certain contexts. These types include: Boolean, Command,
File path, Floating-point numbers, Generator expressions, Integers, and
Targets.

Quasi-CMake types are primarily conceptual descriptions of CMake
types with specific roles not defined in CMake. These types are: Description and Type.
A Description is string that falls under no other intrinsic type than a string. Types
are strings that are reserved for the in-code type keywords for the types described here,
like `str` for a string, `int` for an integer, and `desc` for a description.

CMakePPLang also defines types that are outside of what can easily be
represented in CMake: Class, Map, and Object. The Class type is used for
objects which hold the specification of a user-defined type. Classes in
CMakePPLang can contain attributes and functions and support inheritance.
Instances of these user-defined classes can be created to be used in CMake
modules. Currently, Classes are represented using Maps. An object of the
Map type is an associative array for storing key-value pairs. The CMakePPLang
Map provides the same basic functionality as a C++ `std::map`[@cpp_stdmap_2023], Python
`dictionary`[@python_map_2023], or JavaScript `Map`[@javascript_map_2023]. Users can use maps in
their code wherever they see fit, and maps are used in CMakePPLang to hold the
state of object instances. Finally, the Object type is the base class for all
user-defined classes. The CMakePPLang Object defines the default
implementations for the equality, copy, and serialization functionalities.
