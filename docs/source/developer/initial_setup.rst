Setting Up CMakePPLang for Development
**************************************

This page contains information to help developers new to CMakePPLang set up
the project to begin development.

Downloading the Source Code
===========================

During development, the latest version of CMakePPLang should be used.
CMakePPLang is `hosted on GitHub <CMakePPLang_src_>`__ and can be cloned to
your local system using Git_:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/CMakePP/CMakePPLang.git

Building CMakePPLang
====================

CMakePPLang is built on top of and extends the `CMake language <CMake_>`__, so
"building" CMakePPLang is performed during CMake's configuration step. Once
the CMakePPLang source code has been downloaded, navigate into the new
``CMakePPLang`` directory and run the following command to "build" CMakePPLang:

For \*nix-based systems (including Mac OSX):

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake -H. -Bbuild -DBUILD_TESTING=ON

For Windows systems:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake -S. -Bbuild -DBUILD_TESTING=ON

In these commands, ``-H`` and ``-S`` specify the top-level, root directory for
the project, called the "source directory" in CMake (not to be confused with a
"source code directory", commonly also called the "source directory"). In this
case, we are assuming that the current directory, ``.``, is the root directory
of the ``CMakePPLang`` repository. The directory where build artifacts will
appear is specified by ``-B``, meaning we are directing build artifacts to
``CMakePPLang/build``. Finally, ``-DBUILD_TESTING=ON`` enables unit testing on
CMakePPLang, which will be necessary for development. ``BUILD_TESTING``
defaults to ``OFF``, so this argument can be excluded if testing is not needed.

.. note::

   The build step usually required by projects using CMake is not required to
   build CMakePPLang itself, so it is not included in this section.

Running CMakePPLang Tests
=========================

Scripts to run the unit tests will be included in ``CMakePPLang/build`` with
the rest of the build artifacts. These scripts are run using CMake's test driver
program, CTest_. Navigate into the ``CMakePPLang/build`` directory and run
the following command to execute CMakePPLang's tests:

.. code-block:: bash

   ctest --output-on-failure

While ``ctest`` can be run with no arguments as well, it is usually useful to
run it with ``--output-on-failure``, since it will provide all of the output
from a failing test program instead of simply saying the test failed. After
the first run of the tests, it is also useful to include ``--rerun-failed``
to save time by skipping passing tests.

.. note::
