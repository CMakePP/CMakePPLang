Getting Started
###############

This part provides some helpful information for users who want to get started
using CMakePPLang. If you are unfamiliar with the CMake language, it is best to
start by learning the basics of the CMake language (`CMake introduction`_,
`CMake development tutorial`_). If you are already familiar with the CMake
language, start by :ref:`auto-downloading-cmakepplang` and then move on to
:ref:`cmakepplang-examples` to learn the basics of using CMakePPLang.
