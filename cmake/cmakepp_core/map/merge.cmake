#[[[ Adds the key-value pairs from one dictionary to another.
#
# This function adds all the key-value pairs from _m_this into
# _m_other. If a key is present in both dictionary, the value from _m_other
# will overwrite the value in _m_this.
#
# :param _m_this: The map that will have the key-value pairs added to it.
# :type _m_this: map
# :param _m_other: The map whose key-value pairs will be added to _m_this.

# Error Checking
# ==============
#
# If CMakePP is run in debug mode this function will assert that it was called
# with exactly two arguments, and that those arguments have the correct types.
# If these assertions fail an error will be raised. These checks are only
# performed if CMakePP is run in debug mode.
#
# :var CMAKEPP_CORE_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
#                               debug mode or not.
# :vartype CMAKEPP_CORE_DEBUG_MODE: bool
