#[[[
# Determines if a map has the specified key.
#
# This function is used to determine if a particular key has been set for this
# map.
#
# :param this: The map for which we want to know if it has the specified
#              key.
# :type this: map
# :param result: Name to use for the variable which will hold the result.
# :type result: desc
# :param key: The key we want to know if the map has.
# :type key: str
# :returns: ``result`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if ``key`` has been
#           set for this map and ``FALSE`` otherwise.
# :rtype: bool
#
# :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
#                               debug mode or not.
# :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
#
# Error Checking
# ==============
#
# If CMakePP is run in debug mode this function will assert that it was called
# with exactly two arguments, and that those arguments have the correct types.
# If these assertions fail an error will be raised. These checks are only
# performed if CMakePP is run in debug mode.
