#[[[ Makes a deep copy of a Map instance.
#
# This function will deep copy (recursively) the contents of a map into a new
# Map instance. The resulting instance will not alias the original map in any
# way.
#
# :param _mc_this: The Map instance being copied.
# :type _mc_this: map
# :param _mc_other: The name of the variable which will hold the deep copy.
# :type _mc_other: desc
# :returns: ``_mc_other`` will be set to a deep copy of ``_mc_this``.
# :rtype: map
#
# Error Checking
# ==============
#
# If CMakePP is run in debug mode ``cpp_map_copy`` will ensure that the caller
# has provided only two arguments and that those arguments are of the correct
# types. This error check is only performed if CMakePP is being run in debug
# mode.
#
# :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
#                               debug mode or not.
# :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
