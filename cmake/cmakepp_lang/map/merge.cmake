# Adds the key-value pairs from one dictionary to another.

# will overwrite the value in _m_this.

# :type this: map
# :param other: The map whose key-value pairs will be added to _m_this.

# Error Checking
# ==============
#
# If CMakePP is run in debug mode this function will assert that it was called
# with exactly two arguments, and that those arguments have the correct types.
# If these assertions fail an error will be raised. These checks are only
# performed if CMakePP is run in debug mode.
