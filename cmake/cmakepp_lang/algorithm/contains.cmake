#[[[
# Determines if an element appears in a set-like object.
#
# This function is meant to function like Python's ``in`` operation. Basically
# it encapsulates the process of checking if ``x`` is in ``y``. What "is in"
# means depends on the types of ``x`` and ``y``. For example if ``y`` is a list,
# then "is in" checks to see if ``x`` is an item in that list. Alternatively if
# ``y`` is a string then this function will check if ``x`` is a substring of
# ``y``.
#
# :param result: Name for the variable to hold the result.
# :type result: desc
# :param item: The item whose inclusion in ``list`` is in question.
# :type item: str
# :param list: The collection we are looking for ``item`` in.
# :type list: str
# :returns: ``result`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if ``item`` is in
#           ``list`` and ``FALSE`` otherwise.
# :rtype: bool
#
# :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
#                               debug mode or not.
# :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
#
# Example Usage
# =============
#
# The following snippet shows how to determine if the word ``"hello"`` is in the
# list ``"hello;world"``.
#
# .. code-block:: cmake
#
#    include(cmakepp_lang/logic/contains)
#    set(a_list "hello" "world")
#    cpp_contains(result "hello" "${a_list}")
#    message("The list contains 'hello': ${result}")  # Will print TRUE
# 
# Error Checking
# ==============
#
# If CMakePP is run in debug mode this function will ensure that it is called
# with the correct number of arguments and that those arguments have the correct
# types. These error checks are only performed if CMakePP is run in debug mode.
