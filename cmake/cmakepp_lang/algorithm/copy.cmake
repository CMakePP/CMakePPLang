# Creates a new object which is a deep copy of an already existing object.

# :type result: desc
# :param obj2copy: The object we are deep copying
# :type obj2copy: str
# :returns: ``result`` will be set to a deep copy of ``obj2copy``.

# Error Checking
# ==============
#
# If CMakePP is being run in debug mode this function will ensure that it has
# been called with exactly two arguments and that those arguments have the
# correct types. If any of these assertions fail, an error will be raised. These
# error checks are done only if CMakePP is being run in debug mode.
