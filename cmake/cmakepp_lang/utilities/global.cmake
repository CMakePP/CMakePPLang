# Appends a value to a global list.
#
# When we are manipulating a global state, which is actually a list, we often
# want to append to it and not "set" it (set in this context referring to
# overwriting the value with a new value). This function will append to the
# specified global variable the provided value. If the variable does not exist,
# the variable will be created and initialized to the provided value.
#
# :param key: The name of the global variable to append to. ``key`` is
#             case-insensitive.
# :type key: desc
# :param value: The value to append to ``key``'s current value.
# :type value: str
#
# Error Checking
# ==============
#
# ``cpp_append_global`` will assert that it is called with only two arguments.

# Retrieves the value of the requested global variable.
#
# This function will get the value of the specified global variable. If the
# variable does not exist the empty string will be returned. It is thus not
# possible to discern between an uninitialized global variable and one set to
# the empty string. In practice this is not a problem because global variables
# are not typically set to the empty string.

# :param result: Identifier for the variable which after this call will hold
#                    the value stored in global variable ``key``.
# :type value: desc
# :param key: The name of the global variable whose value has been
#                 requested. ``key`` is case-insensitive.
# :type key: desc
# :returns: ``result`` will be set to the value stored in global variable
#           ``key``. If ``key`` has not been set ``result`` will be
#           set to the empty string.
