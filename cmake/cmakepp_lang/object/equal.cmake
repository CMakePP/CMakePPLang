#[[[
# Compares two objects for equality.
#
# This function is the default equality comparison for all user-defined classes.
# It can be overridden by the derived class if a different implementation is
# needed. The default implementation ensures that the objects have the same
# most-derived type and that their states compare equal (their states are stored
# in maps and we simply compare the maps).
#
# :param this: One of the two Object instances being compared.
# :type this: obj
# :param result: Name for variable which will hold the comparison's result.
# :type result: desc
# :param other: The other Object instance being compared.
# :type other: obj
# :returns: ``_oe_result`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if the instances are equal
#           and ``FALSE`` otherwise.
# :rtype: bool
#
# :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
#                               debug mode or not.
# :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
#
# Error Checking
# ==============
#
# If CMakePP is being run in debug mode (and only then) this function will
# ensure that the caller has provided exactly three arguments and that the
# arguments are of the correct types. If this is not the case an error will be
# raised.
