# Determines the correct member function to call for the input.

# the caller's namespace with temporary variables needed to lookup the symbol of
# the member function we are calling.

# :param this: The Object instance whose member function is being called.
# :type this: obj
# :param result: Identifier to hold the symbol of the function to call.
# :type result: desc
# :param method: The name of the method to call. The actual name is
#                case-insensitive.
# :type method: desc
# :param \*args: The arguments which are being forwarded to the member function.
# :returns: ``result`` will be set to the symbol (mangled name) of the
#           member function to call.
# :rtype: fxn
#
# .. note::
#
#    This function is considered an implementation detail of
#    ``object_call`` and does not perform any type checking.
#
# Error Checking
# ==============
#
# This function will raise an error if the Object instance does not contain a
# member function capable of being called with the provided signature.

# Calls the specified member function.
#
# This is the "public" API (users of CMakePP should rarely need to go through
# the Object class directly) for calling an Object instance's member function.
# This function encapsulates the process of determining the correct overload to
# call and actually invoking it.
#
# :param this: The Object instance whose member function is being called.
# :type this: obj
# :param method: The name of the member function to call.
# :type method: desc
# :param \*args: The arguments to forward to the member function (the required
#                first argument of the ``this`` pointer is forwarded
#                automatically and should not be provided in this list)
# :returns: This function will return whatever the member function returns
#           using the mechanism of that function. If the member function does
#           not return this function will not return.

# Error Checking
# ==============
#
# If CMakePP is run in debug mode (and only if CMakePP is run in debug mode)
# this function will ensure that it was called with the correct number and types
# of arguments. If it is not an error will be raised.
#
# Additionally, this function will raise an error if the Object instance does
# not contain a suitable overload for the provided arguments.
