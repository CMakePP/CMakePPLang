# Returns a new default constructed Object instance.
#
# This function creates a new default constructed Object instance. This instance
# is only an Object instance (contrast this with derived class instances created
# using ``_cpp_object_ctor``). All instances of the Object class have identical
# state and thus for efficiency reasons it makes sense to have a single Object
# instance that all derived class instances alias.
#
# :param this: Name for the variable which will hold the new instance.
# :type this: desc
# :returns: ``_os_this`` will be set to the newly created Object instance.
# :rtype: obj
#
# :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
#                              debug mode or not.
# :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
#
# .. note::
#
#    This command is a macro so that the member function definitions permeate
#    into the caller's scope.
#
# Error Checking
# ==============
#
# If CMakePP is run in debug mode (and only if CMakePP is run in debug mode)
# this function will ensure that it was called with exactly one argument and
# that the one argument is of type ``desc``. If either of these asserts fails an
# error will be raised.
