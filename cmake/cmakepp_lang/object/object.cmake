# Holds an instance of the ``obj`` class.
#
# All instances of the ``obj`` class are identical and static (well strictly
# speaking a malicious user could modify them). Thus for efficiency we make a
# single instance of the ``obj`` class and have all derived classes alias it.
# For all intents and purposes this makes the object class a singleton. That
# said aside from ``cpp_class()`` needing this variable
# (``__CMAKEPP_LANG_OBJECT_SINGLETON__``) to hold an ``obj`` instance no part of
# CMakePP actually requires there to only be one ``obj`` instance in play at any
# time.
