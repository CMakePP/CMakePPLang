# Finds the proper CTOR function to call for the given object and arguments.
#
# This function checks if the CTOR call was a KWARGS call, a regular CTOR call
# with arguments, or CTOR with no arguments. If it was a KWARGS call, the
# _cpp_set_kwargs_attrs is called. If it was a CTOR call with arguments, it
# attempts to find the CTOR that matches the call signature and call it. If
# no CTOR is called, an error is thrown. If it is an CTOR call with no arguments
# it attempts to find a CTOR with a matching signature but does not throw an
# error if none is found.

# ==============

# called with an obj and a type as the first two parameters.
#
# Additionally, this function will always throw an error if a CTOR call with
# arguments was made an no CTOR can be found matching the signature of the call.
