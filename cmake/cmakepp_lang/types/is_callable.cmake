# Determines if a function can be run as the specified signature.
#
# This function takes two lists ``_ic_fxn`` and ``_ic_args``. Each list is
# interpreted as being a function signature such that the first element is the
# name of the function and the remaining arguments are: the types of the
# arguments the function was declared to take (for ``_ic_fxn``) or the types of
# the arguments being passed in (for ``_ic_args``). This function ultimately
# determines whether there is a series of implicit casts which will convert the
# types in ``_ic_args`` into those in ``_ic_fxn``. If there is than ``_ic_fxn``
# is callable as the signature provided by ``_ic_args``. If there is no such set
# of casts then ``_ic_fxn`` is not callable with the signature provided by
# ``_ic_args``.
#
# :param result: Name of the variable which will hold the result.
# :type result: desc
# :param fxn: The signature of the function we are trying to cast to.
# :type fxn: list*
# :param args: The signature of the function we are trying to cast from.
# :type args: list*
# :returns: ``_ic_result`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if ``_ic_args`` can be cast
#           to ``_ic_fxn`` and ``FALSE`` otherwise.

# If CMakePP is run in debug mode this function will ensure that only three

# these asserts fail an error will be raised. These assertions are only done in
# debug mode.
