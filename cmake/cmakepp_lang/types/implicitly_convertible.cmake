#[[[
# Determines if an object of a given type can be passed as a different type.
#
# CMakePP is a strongly-typed language with minimal implicit conversions. This
# function knows of all allowed implicit conversions and should be used to
# determine if it is okay to use one type in place of another.
#
# .. note::
#
#    This function is used to implement ``cpp_assert_signature`` and thus can
#    not rely on ``cpp_assert_signature`` for type-checking.
#
# :param _ic_result: Name to use for the variable which will hold the result.
# :type _ic_result: desc
# :param _ic_from: The type we are attempting to cast from.
# :type _ic_from: type
# :param _ic_to: The type we are attempting to cast to.
# :type _ic_to: type
# :returns: ``_ic_result`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if an instance of
#           ``_ic_from`` can be implicitly converted to an instance of
#           ``_ic_to`` and ``FALSE`` otherwise.

# Error Checking
# ==============
#
# ``cpp_implicitly_convertible`` will assert that it is called with only three
# arguments, if this is not the case an error will be raised.
