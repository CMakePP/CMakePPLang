.. module:: cmakepp_lang.object/serialize


.. function:: _cpp_object_serialize(_os_this _os_result)

   Serializes an object into JSON format.
   
   This function is the default implementation for serializing an object. Derived
   classes are free to override it with their own implementations. This
   implementation simply treats the object as a map with a single key-value pair
   comprised of the "this" pointer (as the key) and the serialized state of the
   object as the value.
   
   :param _os_this: The object we are serializing.
   :type _os_this: obj
   :param _os_result: Name for the identifier which will hold the serialized
                      value.
   :type _os_result: desc
   :returns: ``_os_result`` will be set to the JSON serialized representation of
             ``_os_this``.
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode (and only if it is) this function will assert
   that the caller has provided exactly two arguments and that those arguments
   have the correct types. If any assertion fails an error is raised.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   


.. function:: _cpp_object_print(_op_this)

   Prints an object to standard out.
   
   This function is code factorization for serializing an object and printing the
   serialized form to standard out.
   
   :param _op_this: The object we are printing to standard out.
   :type _op_this: obj
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode (and only if it is) this function will ensure
   that it was called with a single argument and that the argument is implicitly
   convertible to an Object. If either of these assertions fail an error will be
   raised.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
