.. function:: _cpp_object_get_attr_guts(_ogag_this _ogag_value _ogag_done _ogag_attr)

   Core of the routine which retrieves the attributes.
   
   Attributes need to be searched for using depth-first search. This function
   implements the part of the search which is done recursively for each class of
   the hierarchy associated with this instance's class. This function will work
   regardless of whether or not the object has the requested attribute. If the
   object does not
   
   :param _ogag_this: The instance in which we are looking for the attribute.
   :type _ogag_this: obj
   :param _ogag_value: Identifier for the variable which will hold the value of
                       the attribute.
   :type _ogag_value: desc
   :param _ogag_done: Identifier which will hold whether or not the recursion is
                      done.
   :type _ogag_done: desc
   :param _ogag_attr: Name of the attribute we are looking for.
   :type _ogag_attr: desc
   :returns: ``_ogag_value`` will be set to the value of the attribute, if the
             object has the attribute and the empty string otherwise.
             ``_ogag_done`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if the object has the
             attribute and ``FALSE`` otherwise. Hence one can use ``_ogag_done``
             to determine if the attribute does not exist, or if it was just set
             to an empty string.
   :rtype: (str, bool)
   
   .. note::
   
      This function is considered an implementation detail and performs no error
      checking on its own.
   


.. function:: _cpp_object_get_attr(_oga_this)

   Retrieves the value of an object's attribute.
   
   This is the "public" API (for the most part users shouldn't be going through
   the Object API at all) for accessing the attributes of an Object instance.
   This function can get one attribute or multiple depending on the signature
   of the call.
   
   Single Attribute GET Signature:
   _cpp_object_get_attr(this value attribute)
   
   Here "this" is the object to retrieve the attribute from, "value" is the
   handle where the attribute is to be returned to the parent scope, and
   "attribute" is the name of the attribute to be retrieved.
   
   Multiple Attribute GET Signature:
   _cpp_object_get_attr(this prefix attrs)
   
   Here is the object to retrieve the attributes from, prefix will be prepended
   to the each attributes name and used as the handle where that attribute is
   returned to the parent scope, and attributes is the list of attributes to
   retrieve.
   
   :param _oga_this: The object whose attribute is being accessed.
   :type _oga_this: obj
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is being run in debug mode this function will ensure that it was
   called with exactly three arguments and that the arguments have the correct
   type. If any of these assertions fail an error will be raised. These errors
   are only considered if CMakePP is being run in debug mode.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   
   Additionally, this function will always assert that the object possesses the
   requested attribute. If the object does not posses the attribute an error will
   be raised.
   


.. function:: _cpp_object_set_attr(_osa_this _osa_attr)

   Sets the value of an Object instance's attribute.
   
   This function is the "public" API (generally speaking users of CMakePP should
   not be going through the Object API) for setting an Object's attribute. This
   is the function that is ultimately called by ``cpp_attr`` and by the ``SET``
   member function. If the object already has the specified attribute, this
   function will overwrite its value.
   
   :param _osa_this: The Object instance whose attribute is being set.
   :type _osa_this: obj
   :param _osa_attr: The name of the attribute we are setting.
   :type _osa_attr: desc
   :param \*args: The value or values the attribute will be set as.
