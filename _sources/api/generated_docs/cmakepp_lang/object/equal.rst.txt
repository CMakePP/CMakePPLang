.. module:: cmakepp_lang.object/equal


.. function:: _cpp_object_equal(_oe_this _oe_result _oe_other)

   Compares two objects for equality.
   
   This function is the default equality comparison for all user-defined classes.
   It can be overridden by the derived class if a different implementation is
   needed. The default implementation ensures that the objects have the same
   most-derived type and that their states compare equal (their states are stored
   in maps and we simply compare the maps).
   
   :param _oe_this: One of the two Object instances being compared.
   :type _oe_this: obj
   :param _oe_result: Name for variable which will hold the comparison's result.
   :type _oe_result: desc
   :param _oe_other: The other Object instance being compared.
   :type _oe_other: obj
   :returns: ``_oe_result`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if the instances are equal
             and ``FALSE`` otherwise.
   :rtype: bool
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is being run in debug mode (and only then) this function will
   ensure that the caller has provided exactly three arguments and that the
   arguments are of the correct types. If this is not the case an error will be
   raised.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
