.. module:: cmakepp_lang.object/copy


.. function:: _cpp_object_copy(_oc_this _oc_other)

   Deep copies an Object instance.
   
   This function is the default copy implementation for all user-defined objects.
   It can be overridden in the base class if desired. The default implementation
   simply deep copies recursively the entirety of the Object's state.
   
   :param this: The Object instance which is being copied.
   :type this: obj
   :param other: Name for the variable which will hold the copy.
   :type other: desc
   :returns: ``_oc_other`` will be set to a deep copy of ``_oc_this``.
   :rtype: obj
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode (and only if CMakePP is run in debug mode)
   this function will ensure that it was called with the correct number and types
   of arguments.
