.. module:: cmakepp_lang.object/add_fxn


.. function:: _cpp_object_add_fxn(_oaf_this _oaf_name)

   Register's a member function with the object.
   
   This function is used to add a member function to an object. The member
   function will override member functions in base classes with the same
   signature and overload member functions with the same name, but different
   signatures.
   
   :param _oaf_this: The Object instance we are adding the function to.
   :type _oaf_this: obj
   :param _oaf_name: The name of the function we are adding.
   :type _oaf_name: desc
   :param \*args: The types of the arguments to the function.
   :returns: ``_oaf_name`` will be set to the mangled name of the function which
             was added. Users should use the mangled name when implementing the
             function.
   :rtype: desc
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is being run in debug mode this function will assert that it was
   called with the correct number and types of arguments. If this is not the case
   an error will be raised. These error checks are only performed if CMakePP is
   being run in debug mode.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
