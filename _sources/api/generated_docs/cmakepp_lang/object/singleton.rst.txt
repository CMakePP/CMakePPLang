.. module:: cmakepp_lang.object/singleton


.. function:: _cpp_object_singleton(_os_this)


   .. note:: This is a macro, and so does not introduce a new scope.

   Returns a new default constructed Object instance.
   
   This function creates a new default constructed Object instance. This instance
   is only an Object instance (contrast this with derived class instances created
   using ``_cpp_object_ctor``). All instances of the Object class have identical
   state and thus for efficiency reasons it makes sense to have a single Object
   instance that all derived class instances alias.
   
   :param _os_this: Name for the variable which will hold the new instance.
   :type _os_this: desc
   :returns: ``_os_this`` will be set to the newly created Object instance.
   :rtype: obj
   
   .. note::
   
      This command is a macro so that the member function definitions permeate
      into the caller's scope.
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode (and only if CMakePP is run in debug mode)
   this function will ensure that it was called with exactly one argument and
   that the one argument is of type ``desc``. If either of these asserts fails an
   error will be raised.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
