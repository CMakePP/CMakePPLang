.. module:: cmakepp_lang.object/get_meta_attr


.. function:: _cpp_object_get_meta_attr(_ogma_this _ogma_result _ogma_attr)

   Encapsulates the process of retrieving an object's meta attributes.
   
   Each Object instance has several attributes which are meant purely for use by
   CMakePP to make the Object work. These attributes are special and sequestered
   from the normal instance attributes and termed "meta-attributes". This
   function is designed to encapsulate the process of retrieving a
   meta-attribute's value. If an attribute exists this function will return its
   value, if the attribute does not exist than this function will return the
   empty string. At the moment there is no way to distinguish between a
   meta-attribute set to the empty string and a non-existing meta-attribute.
   
   :param this: The object instance whose meta-attribute is being
                      retrieved.
   :type this: obj
   :param result: Name for the variable which will hold the value.
   :type result: desc
   :param attr: The name of the meta-attribute we are retrieving.
   :type attr: desc
   :returns: ``_ogma_result`` will be set to the value of the attribute (if the
             attribute exists) and the empty string otherwise.
   :rtype: str
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode (and only if CMakePP is run in debug mode)
   this function will assert that it has been called with exactly three arguments
   and that those arguments have the correct types. If any assertion fails an
   error will be raised.
