.. function:: cpp_map_append(_ma_this _ma_key _ma_value)

   Appends to the value stored under the specified key.
   
   This member function will append the provided value to the list stored under
   the specified key. If the key does not exist, a list will be started with the
   provided value and stored under the specified key.
   
   :param _ma_this: The map we modifying the state of.
   :type _ma_this: map
   :param _ma_key: The key whose value is being appended to.
   :type _ma_key: str
   :param _ma_value: Value we are appending to the list stored under ``_ma_key``.
   :type _ma_value: str

   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode, this function will assert that it is called
   with the correct number of arguments and that each argument has the correct
   type. If an assert fails an error will be raised. The assertions happen only
   when CMakePP is run in debug mode.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.

.. function:: cpp_map_ctor(_mc_result)

   Constructs a new Map instance with the specified state (if provided)
   
   This function creates a new Map instance. The caller may provided one or more
   pairs of input to be used as the initial state. If provided, the pairs are
   assumed to be such that the first value is the key and the second value is the
   value to associate with that key. If no key-value pairs are provided the
   resulting map will be empty.
   
   :param _mc_result: Name for variable which will hold the new map.
   :type _mc_result: desc
   :param \*args: A list whose elements will be considered pairwise to be the
                 initial key-value pairs populating the map.
   :returns: ``_mc_result`` will be set to the newly created Map instance.
   :rtype: map

   If CMakePP is run in debug mode this function will assert that it has been
   called with at least one argument, that this argument is of type ``desc``,
   and that any additional arguments are of type ``(desc, str)``. If any of these
   assertions fail an error will be raised. These assertions are only performed
   if CMakePP is run in debug mode.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in

.. function:: cpp_map_get(_mg_this _mg_value _mg_key)

   Retrieves the value of the specified key.
   
   This function is used to retrieve the value associated with the provided key.
   If a key has not been set this function will return the empty string. Users
   can use ``cpp_map_has_key`` to determine whether the map does not have the
   key or if the key was simply set to the empty string.
   
   :param _mg_this: The map storing the key-value pairs.
   :type _mg_this: map
   :param _mg_value: Name for the identifier to save the value to.
   :type _mg_value: desc
   :param _mg_key: The key whose value we want.
   :type _mg_key: str
   :returns: ``_mg_value`` will be set to the value associated with ``_mg_key``.
             If ``_mg_key`` has no value associated with it ``_mg_value`` will be
             set to the empty string.
   :rtype: str
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode this function will ensure that it has been
   provided exactly three arguments and that those arguments are of the correct
   types. If any of these checks fail an error will be raised. These checks are
   only performed if CMakePP is being run in debug mode.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode.

.. function:: cpp_map_set(_ms_this _ms_key _ms_value)

   Associates a value with the specified key.
   
   This function can be used to set the value of a map's key. If the key has a
   value associated with it already that value will be overridden.
   
   :param _ms_this: The map whose key is going to be set.
   :type _ms_this: map
   :param _ms_key: The key whose value is going to be set.
   :type _ms_key: str
   :param _ms_value: The value to set the key to.
   :type _ms_value: str

   If CMakePP is run in debug mode this function will assert that it was called
   with exactly three arguments, and that those arguments have the correct types.
   If these assertions fail an error will be raised. These checks are only
   performed if CMakePP is run in debug mode.

.. function:: cpp_map(_m_mode _m_this)

   Public API for interacting with Map instances.
   
   
   :param _m_mode: The name of the member function to call.
   :type _m_mode: desc
   :param _m_this: The Map instance the member function is being called on.
   :type _m_this: map
   :param \*args: Any additional arguments required by the specified member
                 function.
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is being run in debug mode, the individual member functions will
   ensure that they have been called with correct number of, and types of,
   arguments. In the event that the incorrect number or types of arguments have
   been provided an error will be raised. These error checks are only done when
   CMakePP is run in debug mode.
