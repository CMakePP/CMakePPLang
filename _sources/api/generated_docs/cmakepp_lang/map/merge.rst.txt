.. module:: cmakepp_lang.map/merge


.. function:: cpp_map_merge(_m_this _m_other)

   Adds the key-value pairs from one dictionary to another.
   
   This function adds all the key-value pairs from _m_this into
   _m_other. If a key is present in both dictionary, the value from _m_other
   will overwrite the value in _m_this.
   
   :param _m_this: The map that will have the key-value pairs added to it.
   :type _m_this: map
   :param _m_other: The map whose key-value pairs will be added to _m_this.
   :type _m_other: map
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode this function will assert that it was called
   with exactly two arguments, and that those arguments have the correct types.
   If these assertions fail an error will be raised. These checks are only
   performed if CMakePP is run in debug mode.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
