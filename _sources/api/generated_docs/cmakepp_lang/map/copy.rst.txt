.. module:: cmakepp_lang.map/copy


.. function:: cpp_map_copy(_mc_this _mc_other)

   Makes a deep copy of a Map instance.
   
   This function will deep copy (recursively) the contents of a map into a new
   Map instance. The resulting instance will not alias the original map in any
   way.
   
   :param _mc_this: The Map instance being copied.
   :type _mc_this: map
   :param _mc_other: The name of the variable which will hold the deep copy.
   :type _mc_other: desc
   :returns: ``_mc_other`` will be set to a deep copy of ``_mc_this``.
   :rtype: map
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode ``cpp_map_copy`` will ensure that the caller
   has provided only two arguments and that those arguments are of the correct
   types. This error check is only performed if CMakePP is being run in debug
   mode.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
