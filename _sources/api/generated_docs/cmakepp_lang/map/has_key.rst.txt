.. function:: cpp_map_has_key(_mhk_this _mhk_result _mhk_key)

   Determines if a map has the specified key.
   
   This function is used to determine if a particular key has been set for this
   map.
   
   :param this: The map for which we want to know if it has the specified
                     key.
   :type this: map
   :param result: Name to use for the variable which will hold the result.
   :type result: desc
   :param key: The key we want to know if the map has.
   :type key: str
   :returns: ``_mhk_result`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if ``_mhk_key`` has been
             set for this map and ``FALSE`` otherwise.
   :rtype: bool
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode this function will assert that it was called
   with exactly two arguments, and that those arguments have the correct types.
   If these assertions fail an error will be raised. These checks are only
   performed if CMakePP is run in debug mode.
