.. module:: cmakepp_lang.class/set_kwargs_attrs


.. function:: _cpp_set_kwargs_attrs(_ska_this)

   Reads KWARGS and assigns sets the appropriate attributes values.
   
   This function takes in an object (an instance of a class) and the KWARGS
   passed to that object's CTOR. It parses the keywords and values from those
   KWARGS and sets the attribute values of the object. For example a class called
   MyClass with attributes "a", "b", and "c" might get a call to its CTOR like:
   
   MyClass(CTOR my_instances KWARGS a red b orange yellow green c blue)
   
   This function would assign the following for my_instance's attributes"
   a = red, b = orange;yellow;green, c = blue
   
   :param _ska_this: The object whose KWARG CTOR was called
   :type _ska_this: obj
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is being run in debug mode this function will ensure that it was
   called with and object as the first argument.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   
   Additionally, this function will ensure that the proper syntax is used for
   the list of KWARGS. That is the KWARGS must consist of pairings of attribute
   name and then one or more values and so on.
