.. module:: cmakepp_lang.class/flatten_attrs


.. function:: _cpp_flatten_attrs(_fa_this)

   Flattens the attributes from an objects subobjects into that objects
   attributes.
   
   This function removes all the attributes from an object's subobjects and
   adds them to that object.
   
   :param this: The objects whose attributes will be flattened.
   :type this: obj
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode this function will assert that it was called
   with exactly one argument and that that argument is an object. If this
   assertion fails an error will be raised. These checks are only performed if
   CMakePP is run in debug mode.
