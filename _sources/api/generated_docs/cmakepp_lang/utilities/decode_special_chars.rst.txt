.. module:: cmakepp_lang.utilities/decode_special_chars


.. function:: cpp_decode_special_chars(_dsc_argn _dsc_return_argn)

   Decodes special characters to protect them during function passes.
   
   This function decodes special characters that need to be escaped in a CMake
   string to protect them while being passed as function parameters through 
   multiple functions. It is assumed that this will be called on the arguments
   immediately before the function is finalized and written to a file.
   
   The special characters handled are ``$;"\\``. For more information about
   why this is necessary, see documentation for ``cpp_encode_special_chars``.
   
   :param _dsc_argn: The argument list. This should have at least one string in
                     it, otherwise this function will have nothing to encode.
   :type _dsc_argn: list
   :param _dsc_return_argn: Return variable for the encoded argument list.
   :type _dsc_return_argn: list
   :returns: The list of arguments with special characters encoded.
   :rtype: list
   
   Example Usage:
   ==============
   
   See documentation for ``cpp_encode_special_chars`` for usage of both the
   encoding and decoding functions.
