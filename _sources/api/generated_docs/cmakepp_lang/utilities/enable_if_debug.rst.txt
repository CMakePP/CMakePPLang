.. module:: cmakepp_lang.utilities/enable_if_debug


.. function:: cpp_enable_if_debug()


   .. note:: This is a macro, and so does not introduce a new scope.

   Logic for enabling/disabling code when CMakePP is run in debug mode.
   
   CMakePP supports a "debug mode" which enables potentially computationally
   expensive logging and error checks. In release mode these operations are
   skipped so that the build proceeds as fast as possible. The
   ``cpp_enable_if_debug`` function will only allow the remainder of the function
   to run if debug mode has been enable (done by setting
   ``CMAKE_CORE_DEBUG_MODE`` to ``TRUE``/``ON``).
   
   :var CMAKE_CORE_DEBUG_MODE: Whether or not CMakePP is being run in debug mode.
   :type CMAKE_CORE_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   
   .. warning::
   
      This function is a macro in order to allow it to prematurely return from
      the function that called it. For this reason it is important that
      ``cpp_enable_if_debug`` is only called from functions and **NOT** macros.
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   ``cpp_enable_if_debug`` will raise an error if it is called with any
   arguments.
