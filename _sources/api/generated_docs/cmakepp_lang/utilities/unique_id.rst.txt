.. module:: cmakepp_lang.utilities/unique_id


.. function:: cpp_unique_id(_ui_id)

   Generates a unique identifier.
   
   This function will create a unique identifier which can be used, for example,
   as the "this" pointer for an object. The uniqueness of the identifier relies
   on mangling the time (with second resolution) and a random string. Thus the
   result should be unique so long as the same random string is not generated
   during the same second. No check for uniqueness is currently present although
   one could be added.
   
   :param _ui_id: The name for the variable which will hold the result.
   :type _ui_id: desc
   :returns: ``_ui_id`` will be set to the generated unique id.
   :rtype: desc
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode ``cpp_unique_id`` will ensure that it was
   passed only one argument and that that argument is of type ``desc``.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
