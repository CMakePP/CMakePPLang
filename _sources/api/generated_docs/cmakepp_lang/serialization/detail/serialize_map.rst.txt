.. module:: cmakepp_lang.serialization/detail/serialize_map


.. function:: _cpp_serialize_map(_sm_return _sm_value)

   Serializes a map using JSON serialization.
   
   This function encapsulates the algorithm required to serialize a CMakePP map
   into JSON. In JSON a map is a container whose contents are enclosed in "{}".
   The contents of the map are expressed as a comma-separated list whose elements
   are the key-value pairs in the form ``<key> : <value>`` where ``<key>`` and
   ``<value>`` are respectively the JSON serialized forms of the key and the
   value.
   
   :param return: Name to use for the variable which will hold the result.
   :type return: desc
   :param value: The map we are serializing.
   :type value: map
   :returns: ``_sm_return`` will be set to the JSON serialized form of
             ``_sm_value``.
   :rtype: desc
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   This routine is considered an implementation detail of ``cpp_serialize`` and
   is not error checked.
