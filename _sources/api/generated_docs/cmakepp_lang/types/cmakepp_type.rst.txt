.. module:: cmakepp_lang.types/cmakepp_type


.. function:: _cpp_get_cmakepp_type(_gct_is_cpp_obj _gct_type _gct_obj)


   .. note:: This is a macro, and so does not introduce a new scope.

   Encapsulates the process of getting a CMakePP object's type.
   
   CMakePP introduces several additional built-in types as well as the ability
   for users to define their own types. This function encapsulates the logic
   to determine if an object is a CMakePP type, and if it is, how to determine
   that type.
   
   :param _gct_is_cpp_obj: Identifier for the variable which will hold whether or
                           not ``_gct_obj`` is a CMakePP object.
   :type _gct_is_cpp_obj: desc
   :param _gct_type: Identifier to hold the type of ``_gct_obj`` if it is indeed
                     a CMakePP object.
   :type _gct_type: desc
   :param _gct_obj: The object for which we want to know if it is a CMakePP
                    object, and if it is, what is its type.
   :type _gct_obj: str
   
   :returns: ``_gct_is_cpp_obj`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if ``_gct_obj`` is a
             CMakePP built-in type or a user-defined type and ``FALSE``
             otherwise. If ``_gct_is_cpp_obj`` is ``TRUE`` than ``_gct_type``
             will be set to the type of ``_gct_obj``. If ``_gct_is_cpp_obj`` is
             ``FALSE`` than ``_gct_type`` will be set to the empty string.
   :rtype: (bool, type) or (bool, desc)
   
   .. note::
   
      This function is used as part of the type-checking machinery and can not
      rely on ``cpp_assert_signature`` to check its input types. It is a macro to
      avoid the need to call ``cpp_return`` to forward the return.
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   ``_cpp_get_cmakepp_type`` will ensure that it was provided three arguments. If
   it was not provided exactly three arguments an error will be raised.
   
   


.. function:: _cpp_set_cmakepp_type(_sct_this _sct_type)

   Encapsulates the process of setting a CMakePP object's type.
   
   CMakePP introduces several additional built-in types as well as the ability
   for users to define their own types. This function encapsulates the logic
   for setting a CMakePP object's type.
   
   .. note::
   
     That before calling this function the "this"-pointer will simply be a
     description. It is this function which makes the CMakePP runtime recognize
     the "this"-pointer as actually-being of the specified type.
   
   :param _sct_this: The "this"-pointer for the CMakePP object we are setting the
                     type of.
   :type _sct_this: desc
   :param _sct_type: The type we are making ``_sct_this``.
   :type _sct_type: type
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   ``_cpp_set_cmakepp_type`` will assert that it is called with exactly two
   arguments, and if it is not, will raise an error.
