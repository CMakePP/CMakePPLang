.. function:: _cpp_compare_names(_cn_result _cn_lhs _cn_rhs)

   Handles logic for comparing the human-readable names of the functions.
   
   This function compares the name part of two signatures (*i.e.*, the 0th
   element) in a case-insensitive manner.
   
   :param _cn_result: The name for the variable which will hold the result.
   :type _cn_result: desc
   :param _cn_lhs: The signature of the first function.
   :type _cn_fxn: list*
   :param _cn_rhs: The signature of the second function.
   :type _cn_fxn: list*
   :returns: ``_cn_result`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if the two signatures have
             the same name (up to case-sensitivity) and ``FALSE`` otherwise.
   :rtype: bool
   
   .. note::
   
      This routine has been factored out to facilitate testing of is_callable. It
      is not meant for use outside of the scope of comparing function signatures.
   
   


.. function:: _cpp_compare_lengths(_cl_result _cl_fxn _cl_args)

   Attempts to rule out a signature match based on length arguments alone.
   
   For non-variadic functions we know that if one signature is longer than the
   other they can't possibly be a match. For a variadic function with :math:`n`
   required positional arguments we know that if the user provided less than
   :math:`n` arguments, this function can not possibly be called with the
   provided arguments.
   
   :param _cl_result: Name for variable which will hold the result.
   :type _cl_result: desc
   :param _cl_fxn: The signature of the function we are trying to call.
   :type _cl_fxn: list*
   :param _cl_args: The signature of how we are trying to call the function.
   :type _cl_args: list*
   :returns: ``_cl_result`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if we can call the function
             with the provided arguments and ``FALSE`` otherwise.
   :rtype: bool
   
   .. note::
   
      This routine has been factored out to facilitate testing of is_callable. It
      is not meant for use outside of the scope of comparing function signatures.
   


.. function:: cpp_is_callable(_ic_result _ic_fxn _ic_args)

   Determines if a function can be run as the specified signature.
   
   This function takes two lists ``_ic_fxn`` and ``_ic_args``. Each list is
   interpreted as being a function signature such that the first element is the
   name of the function and the remaining arguments are: the types of the
   arguments the function was declared to take (for ``_ic_fxn``) or the types of
   the arguments being passed in (for ``_ic_args``). This function ultimately
   determines whether there is a series of implicit casts which will convert the
   types in ``_ic_args`` into those in ``_ic_fxn``. If there is than ``_ic_fxn``
   is callable as the signature provided by ``_ic_args``. If there is no such set
   of casts then ``_ic_fxn`` is not callable with the signature provided by
   ``_ic_args``.
   
   :param _ic_result: Name of the variable which will hold the result.
   :type _ic_result: desc
   :param _ic_fxn: The signature of the function we are trying to cast to.
   :type _ic_fxn: list*
   :param _ic_args: The signature of the function we are trying to cast from.
   :type _ic_args: list*
   :returns: ``_ic_result`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if ``_ic_args`` can be cast
             to ``_ic_fxn`` and ``FALSE`` otherwise.
   :rtype: bool
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode this function will ensure that only three
   arguments are provided and that each argument has the correct type. If any of
   these asserts fail an error will be raised. These assertions are only done in
   debug mode.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
