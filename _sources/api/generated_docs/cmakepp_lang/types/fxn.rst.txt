.. module:: cmakepp_lang.types/fxn


.. function:: cpp_is_fxn(_if_result _if_str2check)

   Determines if a string is lexically convertible to a command.
   
   This function wraps a call to CMake's ``if(COMMAND ...)`` in order to
   determine if the provided string is lexically convertible to a command or not.
   Commands can be native CMake functions or user-defined macro/functions. It
   should be noted that for CMakePP functions it is the mangled name of the
   function which is identified as a command.
   
   :param _if_result: Name for variable which will hold the result of the check.
   :type _if_result: desc
   :param _if_str2check: The string which may be a command.
   :type _if_str: str
   :returns: ``TRUE`` if ``_if_str2check`` is a command and ``FALSE`` otherwise. 
              The result is returned via ``_cip_result``.
   :rtype: bool
   
   Example Usage:
   ==============
   
   The following code snippet checks whether ``add_subdirectory`` is a command:
   
   .. code-block:: cmake
   
      include(cmakepp_lang/types/fxn)
      cpp_is_fxn(result add_subdirectory)
      message("Is a command: ${result}")  # Prints TRUE
