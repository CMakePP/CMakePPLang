.. module:: cmakepp_lang.algorithm/copy


.. function:: cpp_copy(_c_result _c_obj2copy)

   Creates a new object which is a deep copy of an already existing object.
   
   This function will create a deep copy of an existing object regardless of
   what type it is.
   
   :param _c_result: The name of the variable to return the result in.
   :type _c_result: desc
   :param _c_obj2copy: The object we are deep copying
   :type _c_obj2copy: str
   :returns: ``_c_result`` will be set to a deep copy of ``_c_obj2copy``.
   :rtype: str
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is being run in debug mode this function will ensure that it has
   been called with exactly two arguments and that those arguments have the
   correct types. If any of these assertions fail, an error will be raised. These
   error checks are done only if CMakePP is being run in debug mode.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
