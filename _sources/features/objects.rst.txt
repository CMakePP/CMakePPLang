Objects

The ``object`` class is the base class for all user-defined classes. This is the
class that defines the default implementations for the equality, copy, and
serialization functionalities. The member functions of ``object`` that implement
these features are called:

- ``_cpp_object_equal``
- ``_cpp_object_copy``
- ``_cpp_object_serialize``

Currently, these functions cannot be overridden in user defined classes.

.. TODO add when object methods can be overridden
.. The implementations of these functionalities within the object class are what
.. are called by the ``cpp_equal``, ``cpp_copy``, and ``cpp_serialize`` utilities.
.. It is useful to note that these functions may be **overridden** by any class
.. (since all classes inherit from object). Examples of overriding these methods
.. are provided in :ref:`overriding-object-methods`.
..
.. Other than the above, the object class is not assumed to be of much interest
.. to most users of CMakePP.
