.. function:: cpp_file_exists(result file)

   Determines if a provided path points to an existing file.
   
   :param result: Name for variable which will hold the result.
   :type result: desc
   :param file: Path which may be pointing to an existing file.
   :type file: path
   :returns: ``result`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if ``file`` is the
             absolute path of a file and ``FALSE`` otherwise. Of note if
             ``file`` is the absolute path to a directory the result is also
             ``FALSE``.
   :rtype: bool
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode ``cpp_file_exists`` will assert that it has
   been called with two arguments and that those arguments are of the correct
   types.
