.. function:: cpp_directory_exists(result dir)

   Determines if a provided path points to an existing directory.
   
   :param result: Name for variable which will hold the result.
   :type result: bool*
   :param dir: Path which may be pointing to an existing directory.
   :type dir: path
   :returns: ``result`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if ``dir`` is the
             absolute path of a directory and ``FALSE`` otherwise. Of note if
             ``dir`` is the absolute path to a file the result is also
             ``FALSE``.
   :rtype: bool*
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode ``cpp_directory_exists`` will assert that it
   has been called with two arguments and that those arguments are of the correct
   types.
