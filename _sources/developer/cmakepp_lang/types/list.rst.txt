.. module:: cmakepp_lang/types/list


.. function:: cpp_is_list(result str2check)

   Determines if a string is lexically convertible to a CMake list.
   
   CMake lists are strings that contain semicolons. While CMake's list command
   will treat a string without a semicolon as a list with one element, for the
   purposes of determining if a string is a list we require that the list has at
   least two elements (*i.e.*, there must be a semicolon in it). This function
   determines if the provided string meets this definition of a list.
   
   :param result: Used as the name of the returned identifier.
   :type result: desc
   :param str2check: The string whose listy-ness is being questioned.
   :type str2check: str
   :returns: ``result`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if ``str2check`` is a
             list and ``FALSE`` otherwise.
   :rtype: bool
   
   Example Usage
   =============
   
   The following snippet shows how to determine if a variable contains a list.
   
   .. code-block:: cmake
   
      include(cmakepp_lang/types/list)
      set(a_list 1 2 3)
      cpp_is_list(result "${a_list}")
      message("Is a list: ${result}")  # Will print TRUE
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   ``cpp_is_list`` will assert that the caller has provided exactly two
   arguments. If the caller has provided a different number of arguments than an
   error will be raised.
