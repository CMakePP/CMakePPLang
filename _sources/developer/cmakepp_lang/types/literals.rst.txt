.. module:: cmakepp_lang/types/literals

   Defines variables containing lists of valid literals for different data
   types and the type keywords themselves.
   


.. data:: CMAKEPP_BOOL_LITERALS

   A variable containing the recognized bool literals.
   
   The variable ``CMAKEPP_BOOL_LITERALS`` contains a list of the keywords which
   are recognized by CMakePP as being boolean literals. ``CMAKEPP_BOOL_LITERALS``
   only stores the uppercase variants, but all possible case-variants are also
   boolean literals, *i.e*, ``true``, `TrUe``, `y``, etc. are all also boolean
   literals.
   

   :Default value: ON YES TRUE Y OFF NO FALSE N IGNORE NOTFOUND

   :type: list


.. data:: CMAKE_TYPE_LITERALS

   A variable containing the list of types recognized by CMake itself.
   
   The content of CMAKE_TYPE_LITERALS is a list of the literal type for each of
   the recognized intrinsic CMake types. Each type is listed using the official
   CMakePP abbreviation for that type (*i.e.*, the abbreviation which must be
   used for all APIs relying on the type system). Types are stored in snake_case
   and listed alphabetically.
   

   :Default value: bool float fxn genex int list path target type

   :type: list


.. data:: CMAKEPP_TYPE_LITERALS

   the recognized intrinsic CMakePP types. Each type is listed using the official
   CMakePP abbreviation for that type (*i.e.*, the abbreviation which must be
   used for all APIs relying on the type system). Types are stored in snake_case
   and listed alphabetically.
