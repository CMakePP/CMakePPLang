.. module:: cmakepp_lang/types/types

   Since CMakePPLang is strongly typed and CMake is not, various functions are
   needed to determine which CMakePPLang type is contained in a CMake variable.
   This file provides an easy way for the user to include these functions for
   each type, as well as other functions necessary to support this strong
   typing.
