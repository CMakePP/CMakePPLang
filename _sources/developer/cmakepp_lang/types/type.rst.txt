.. module:: cmakepp_lang/types/type


.. function:: cpp_is_type(result type)

   Determines if a string is lexically convertible to a type literal.
   
   CMakePP defines a series of type literals for types recognized by CMake and
   for types recognized by CMake and CMakePP. Additionally, users can create
   classes to add even more type literals. Every type literal
   also has a corresponding pointer type literal, marked with an asterisk.
   This function will determine if an identifier is also a type literal.
   
   :param result: Name for the variable which will hold the result.
   :type result: desc
   :param type: The object for which we want to know if it is a type literal.
   :type type: str
   :returns: ``result`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if ``type`` is a type and
             ``FALSE`` otherwise.
   :rtype: bool
