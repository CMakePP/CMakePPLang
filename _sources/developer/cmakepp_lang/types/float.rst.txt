.. module:: cmakepp_lang/types/float


.. function:: cpp_is_float(return str2check)

   Determines if a string can be lexically cast to a float.
   
   For our purposes a float is any string whose only characters include a decimal
   point, and the numbers 0 through 9. Optionally the float may be prefixed with
   a minus sign.
   
   :param return: Name for the variable used to store the result.
   :type return: desc
   :param str2check: The string we are checking for its floaty-ness
   :type str2check: str
   :returns: ``return`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if ``str2check`` is a
             float and ``FALSE`` otherwise.
   :rtype: bool
   
   Example Usage
   =============
   
   The following is an example showcasing how one would check if the identifier
   ``x`` contained a float.
   
   .. code-block:: cmake
   
      include(cmakepp_lang/types/float)
      set(x 3.14)
      cpp_is_float(return ${x})
      message("3.14 is a float: ${return}")  # prints TRUE
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   ``cpp_is_float`` will assert that it is called with exactly two arguments. If
   it is not an error will be raised.
