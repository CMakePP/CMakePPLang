.. module:: cmakepp_lang/object/get_symbol


.. function:: _cpp_object_get_symbol(this result sig)

   Encapsulates the process of looking up the symbol for a given signature.
   
   This function will search the current instance, as well as all of its
   base class instances looking for a member function which can be called with
   the provided signature. If a suitable overload exists this function will
   return the corresponding symbol. Otherwise it will return ``FALSE``.
   
   :param this: The Object instance whose member functions are being
                considered.
   :type this: obj
   :param result: Name for the variable which will hold the result.
   :type result: desc
   :param sig: A list whose first element is the name of the function and
               whose remaining elements are the types of each positional
               argument.
   :type sig: list*
   :returns: ``result`` will be set to the symbol of the member function
             matching the provided signature (if a suitable match exists) or
             ``FALSE`` if there is no suitable overload.
   :rtype: str
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode (and only if CMakePP is run in debug mode)
   this function will assert that it is called with exactly three arguments and
   that these three arguments have the correct types. If any of these assertions
   fail an error will be raised.
