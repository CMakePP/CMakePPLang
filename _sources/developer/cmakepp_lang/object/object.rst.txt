.. module:: cmakepp_lang/object/object

   Provides an easy way to include the CMakePPLang Object, which all
   user-defined classes will inherit from, as well as related functions to
   manage the Object.
   


.. function:: _cpp_object_singleton(__CMAKEPP_LANG_OBJECT_SINGLETON__)


   .. warning:: This is a generic command invocation. It is not a function or macro definition.

   Holds an instance of the ``obj`` class.
   
   All instances of the ``obj`` class are identical and static (well strictly
   speaking a malicious user could modify them). Thus for efficiency we make a
   single instance of the ``obj`` class and have all derived classes alias it.
   For all intents and purposes this makes the object class a singleton. That
   said aside from ``cpp_class()`` needing this variable
   (``__CMAKEPP_LANG_OBJECT_SINGLETON__``) to hold an ``obj`` instance no part of
   CMakePP actually requires there to only be one ``obj`` instance in play at any
   time.
