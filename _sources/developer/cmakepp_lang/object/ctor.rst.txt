.. function:: _cpp_object_ctor(this type)

   Constructs a new instance of the specified type.
   
   This function constructs a new instance of the specified type. This should not
   be confused with creating a new, default initialized Object instance which is
   done with the ``_cpp_object_singleton`` function. The resulting instance will
   be initialized to the default state for the specified type.
   
   :param this: Name for the variable which will hold the resulting instance.
   :type this: desc
   :param type: The most-derived type of the object we are creating.
   :type type: type
   :param \*args: The initial instances of each direct base class on which this
                  instance should be built.
   :return: ``this`` will be set to the newly created instance.
   :rtype: obj
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is being run in debug mode (and only if CMakePP is being run in
   debug mode) this function will assert that it has been called with the correct
   number and types of arguments. If an assertion fails an error will be raised.
