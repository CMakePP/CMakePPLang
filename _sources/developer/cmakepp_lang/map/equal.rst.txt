.. module:: cmakepp_lang/map/equal


.. function:: cpp_map_equal(this result other)

   Determines if two map instances are equivalent.
   
   Two map instances are considered equal if they contain the same keys and each
   key is associated with the same value. The order of the keys does not need to
   be the same.
   
   :param this: One of the two maps being compared.
   :type this: map
   :param result: Name for the variable which will hold the result.
   :type result: desc
   :param other: The map we are comparing to.
   :type other: map
   :returns: ``result`` will be set to ``TRUE`` if the two map instances
             compare equal and ``FALSE`` otherwise.
   :rtype: bool
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode this function will assert that it was provided
   exactly three arguments, and that those arguments have the correct types. If
   these assertions fail an error will be raised. These error checks are only
   done if CMakePP is run in debug mode.
