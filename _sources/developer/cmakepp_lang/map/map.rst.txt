.. module:: cmakepp_lang/map/map

   Provides an easy way for the user to include the various functions used 
   to create and maintain an instance of a CMakePPLang map.
   


.. function:: cpp_map(mode this)

   Public API for interacting with Map instances.
   
   :param mode: The name of the member function to call.
   :type mode: desc
   :param this: The Map instance the member function is being called on.
   :type this: map
   :param \*args: Any additional arguments required by the specified member
                 function.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is being run in debug mode, the individual member functions will
   ensure that they have been called with correct number of, and types of,
   arguments. In the event that the incorrect number or types of arguments have
   been provided an error will be raised. These error checks are only done when
   CMakePP is run in debug mode.
