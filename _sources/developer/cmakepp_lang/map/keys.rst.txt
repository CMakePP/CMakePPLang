.. function:: cpp_map_keys(this keys)

   Gets a list of all keys known to a map.
   
   This function can be used to get a list of keys which have been set for this
   map.
   
   :param this: The map whose keys are being retrieved.
   :type this: map
   :param keys: Name for the variable which will hold the keys.
   :type keys: desc
   :returns: ``keys`` will be set to the list of keys which have been set for
             ``this``.
   :rtype: [desc]
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode this function will assert that it was called
   with exactly two arguments, and that those arguments have the correct types.
   If these assertions fail an error will be raised. These checks are only
   performed if CMakePP is run in debug mode.
