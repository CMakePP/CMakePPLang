.. module:: cmakepp_lang/map/get_set

   Defines functions to get and set key/value pairs for a CMakePPLang Map.
   


.. function:: cpp_map_get(this value key)

   Retrieves the value of the specified key.
   
   This function is used to retrieve the value associated with the provided key.
   If a key has not been set this function will return the empty string. Users
   can use ``cpp_map_has_key`` to determine whether the map does not have the
   key or if the key was simply set to the empty string.
   
   :param this: The map storing the key-value pairs.
   :type this: map
   :param value: Name for the identifier to save the value to.
   :type value: desc
   :param key: The key whose value we want.
   :type key: str
   :returns: ``value`` will be set to the value associated with ``key``.
             If ``key`` has no value associated with it ``value`` will be
             set to the empty string.
   :rtype: str
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode this function will ensure that it has been
   provided exactly three arguments and that those arguments are of the correct
   types. If any of these checks fail an error will be raised. These checks are
   only performed if CMakePP is being run in debug mode.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   


.. function:: cpp_map_set(this key value)

   Associates a value with the specified key.
   
   This function can be used to set the value of a map's key. If the key has a
   value associated with it already that value will be overridden.
   
   :param this: The map whose key is going to be set.
   :type this: map
   :param key: The key whose value is going to be set.
   :type key: str
   :param value: The value to set the key to.
   :type value: str
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode this function will assert that it was called
   with exactly three arguments, and that those arguments have the correct types.
   If these assertions fail an error will be raised. These checks are only
   performed if CMakePP is run in debug mode.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
