.. module:: cmakepp_lang/map/ctor


.. function:: cpp_map_ctor(result)

   Constructs a new Map instance with the specified state (if provided)
   
   This function creates a new Map instance. The caller may provided one or more
   pairs of input to be used as the initial state. If provided, the pairs are
   assumed to be such that the first value is the key and the second value is the
   value to associate with that key. If no key-value pairs are provided the
   resulting map will be empty.
   
   :param result: Name for variable which will hold the new map.
   :type result: desc
   :param \*args: A list whose elements will be considered pairwise to be the
                 initial key-value pairs populating the map.
   :returns: ``_mc_result`` will be set to the newly created Map instance.
   :rtype: map
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode this function will assert that it has been
   called with at least one argument, that this argument is of type ``desc``,
   and that any additional arguments are of type ``(desc, str)``. If any of these
   assertions fail an error will be raised. These assertions are only performed
   if CMakePP is run in debug mode.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
