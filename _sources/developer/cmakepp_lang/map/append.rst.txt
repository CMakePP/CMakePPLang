   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode, this function will assert that it is called
   with the correct number of arguments and that each argument has the correct
   type. If an assert fails an error will be raised. The assertions happen only
   when CMakePP is run in debug mode.
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
