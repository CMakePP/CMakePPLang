.. module:: cmakepp_lang/class/register_ctor


.. function:: cpp_constructor(name type)

   Registers a class constructor.
   
   This function is used to declare a class constructor.
   
   :param name: The name of the constructor (CTOR by convention). This will be
                   the named used to invoke the member constructor.
   :type name: desc
   :param type: The class we are adding the constructor to.
   :type type: class
   :param \*args: The types of the arguments to the constructor function.
   :returns: ``_c_name`` will be set to the mangled name of the declared
              constructor to facilitate implementing it.
   :rtype: desc
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode (and only if) this function will assert that
   it is called with the correct number and types of arguments. If any of these
   assertions fail an error will be raised.
