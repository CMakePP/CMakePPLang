.. module:: cmakepp_lang/class/member


.. function:: cpp_member(name type)

   Registers a class's member function.
   
   This function is used to declare a new member function.
   
   :param name: The name of the member function. This is the name you will use
                   to invoke the member function.
   :type name: desc
   :param type: The class we are adding the member function to. This is also
                   the type of the "this" pointer.
   :type type: class
   :param \*args: The types of the arguments to the member function. This list
                 should NOT include the type for the this pointer as this will
                 automatically be prepended to this list.
   :returns: ``_m_name`` will be set to the mangled name of the declared
              function to facilitate implementing it.
   :rtype: desc
   
   :var CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: Used to determine if CMakePP is being run in
                                 debug mode or not.
   :vartype CMAKEPP_LANG_DEBUG_MODE: bool
   
   Error Checking
   ==============
   
   If CMakePP is run in debug mode (and only if) this function will assert that
   it is called with the correct number and types of arguments. If any of these
   assertions fail an error will be raised.
