.. module:: cmakepp_lang/serialization/serialization

   Defines the public API for serializing CMake values of various types into a
   JSON formatted string. 
   


.. function:: cpp_serialize(result value)

   Public API for serializing a value to JSON.
   
   When a caller outside of the serialization submodule needs an object
   serialized they should go through this API. This API wraps the (usually)
   recursive procedure required to serialize a complicated object factoring out
   the pieces that only need to be done once.
   
   :param result: The name for the variable which will hold the result.
   :type result: desc
   :param value: The value we are serializing.
   :type value: str
   :returns: ``result`` will be set to the serialized form of``value``.
   :rtype: desc
