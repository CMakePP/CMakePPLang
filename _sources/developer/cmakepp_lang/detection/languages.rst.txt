.. module:: cmakepp_lang/detection/languages


.. function:: cpp_enabled_languages(return_variable)

   Wraps the process of retrieving a list of enabled languages.
   
   CMake sets a global property
   :ref:`ENABLED_LANGUAGES <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_gbl/ENABLED_LANGUAGES.html>` 
   to be a list of coding
   languages which have been enabled either via 
   :ref:`project() <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/project.html>` or 
   the
   :ref:`enable_language() <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/enable_language.html>` 
   commands. CMake's documentation is a bit dodgy in 
   discussing what variables the aforementioned commands set, so we wrote this
   function as a wrapper around the logic in the event that CMake changes how
   they do things. At the very least, this function should be more user-
   friendly.
   
   :param: return_variable A variable to hold the resulting list.
   :type: list*
